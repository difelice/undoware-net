This is the source for undoware.ca, a UX blog powered by Wintersmith, a FOSS Node.js-based static site generator that uses Stylus, Jade, Coffee and Markdown.

Everything is under the MIT license, with two exceptions:

- Except where indicated otherwise, articles (i.e. the contents of /contents/articles/) are under Creative Commons attribution/noncommercial/sharealike license. See <http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/3.0/deed.en_CA>
- Except where indicated otherwise, graphics (i.e. the contents of /contents/raster/, /contents/vector/) are under Creative Commons attribution-only, so they may be re-used by others (provided attribution is given.) Note that the original license supercedes any license stated here, so e.g. if I downloaded an MIT-licensed icon pack, those icons might well be under raster/ and yet still be MIT-licensed. When in doubt, ask.

If you wish to purchase a commerical license for my articles, that's great! Let me know. My prices and conditions are very reasonable, and am usually keen to have a wider audience.
