I am happy to provide a variety of services, including research, copywriting, graphic design, usability testing, interface design (UX), network administration, and software development. Rates vary depending on the service and the amount of work, so please email me at [beth@undoware.ca](mailto:beth@undoware.ca) and we'll talk. Generally, I charge between $20/h (for writing, and/or for FOSS projects) to $90/h (for software development, especially in a lower-level language like C.)

Just to make it explicit: there *is* a sliding scale, and it factors in the going rate for that type of service, how fun it is to do that kind of work, and (most importantly) the social utility and benefit to the commonweal persuant to the intended result. I think rather highly of Creative Commons and Open Source, hint hint.


New! Buy my Backtalk
--------------------------------

One of my favourite things is critiquing software or websites. But it takes time to do right, and I don't work for free.

So here's the deal. You pay me $16USD and I give you a written analysis of your site or app worth about $1,024USD, complete with graphs, suggestions, and a free hug.

But remember how I said I don't work for free? The $1,008USD difference is because (a) I get to keep the copyright and pick the license, and (b) that license will be [Creative Commons Attribution-Sharalike 3.0 Unported](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/3.0/deed.en_CA). Moreover, you agree to let me publish the  report on this blog (undoware.ca), and waive any right you have to sue me (Elizabeth Marston) or Undoware.ca for libel, slander, or insufficient tact.

Hit the big yellow PayPal button immediately below this sentence to begin. Remember, once the transaction has gone through, you've assigned to me the right to praise and/or trash talk you in public, as I see fit.
