I&rsquo;ve decided to try to get famous for writing about writing about getting famous. This seems to encapsulate the core of the Internet self-promotion paradigm -- the geek equivalent of rapping about being a famous rapper.

Except, of course, that instead of *celebrating* fame, I'm writing an exploit. I want to show everyone, me included, how to hack Internet celebritarity, an unnecessary neologism I just made up as a way of assessing market penetration via Google Trends.

The core of the approach is usability-based: I want to make it *so easy* for me to do the things that help generate followers and backlinks that they just sort of happen, unless I make an effort to stop them. In effect, I'm using [persuasive design](http://uxmag.com/articles/why-persuasive-design-should-be-your-next-skill-set) on myself.

The first step is already underway. Thanks to [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io), I now have a blog that is ridiculously easy to maintain, modify, and upgrade. It looks good, and it's usable on tiny devices and huge screens. Your brand needs a cornerstone, and this site is *mine*.

The next step is to create an ecosystem of homebrew publicity tools. When I publish an article, I want:

- Automatic story submission to Hacker News, Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, Google Plus, and GitHub via a CLI
- Comment and backlink aggregation, so probably [Disqus](http://disqus.com) integration on all permalinks
- Cross-media visibility. This means putting as much time into YouTube and Leanpub as Twitter. How to do this efficiently is a good question. Tentatively, I will publish some stories as video articles, and work up popular articles as books.
- Analytics. It is just as easy to write an article that gets attention as it is to write one that does not. So therefore, it is best to know what gets attention.

Stay tuned. :)
