 Until further notice, this site will break with the convention of underlining links, or making them bold, or making them a different color. Instead, they shall be represented by good plain old asterisks. This is because I have been persuaded by [the footnote school of UX design](http://www.roughtype.com/?p=1378). Briefly, the idea is that the usual ways of demarcating a hyperlink are distracting to the reader. In longer copy, hyperlinks should be there when you need them, but almost unnoticed otherwise.

 Up until today, hyperlinks on this site were invisible in body text until you hovered your mouse over them, but this has proven annoying, especially on touchscreens. I even find myself frowning, tapping away at seemingly nonresponsive text, and I'm the writer! I infer from this that the links on my site were broken for touch users, who cannot mouse over the links to see them light up.

 A hyperlink is just a fancy name for a footnote. So why not represent them as footnotes?

 Thus, henceforth, links in article text on this site are demarcated with a simple asterisk immediately following the last word of the link. In effect, it's a footnote without a number. Click on the asterisk or the link body, and everything goes like you'd expect.

 I find this is more satisfying than any combination of colour, font, weight and style. What do you think?
