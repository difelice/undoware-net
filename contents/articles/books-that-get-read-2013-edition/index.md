blurb: Copyhackers teaches startup kids to write, but along the way they accidentally reinvented the book.

Copyhackers.com has the bril idea of teaching startup kids what they didn't learn about writing in English class. But that's not the *brilliant* bril idea. The real Neural Event of Genius is that (a) they persuade you to sign up for a newsletter, and (b) that newsletter is actually a book, being dribbled into your inbox at a rate of one chapter a day.

I could gush here but I don't have to. Instead let's don our usability caps and compare workflows:
<hr>

###Traditional book (pre-Amazon)

1. Maybe go to store
1. Maybe buy book
1. Come home
1. Maybe read it

Think of this pipe like a plumber would: three out of four joins are leaking.

###Traditional book (post-Amazon, pre-Kindle)

1. Definitely go to Amazon.com
1. Probably buy book
1. Wait for delivery
1. Maybe read it

Less leakage, but authors are still sinners in the hands of an absentminded god.

###eBook (Kindle, iBook)

1. Pick up tablet
1. See a book? Open it. Oh look, you just bought it!
1. Read a couple pages, forget about it
1. Feel guilty; come back to it
1. Repeat until you get frustrated with yourself and go look at pictures of cats.

Are shame and guilt really what you want (at least some) of your readers to feel? Fine, I hear you say, let's go DIY and blog the sucker:

###Blog (like this one)

1. See an article pop up on an aggregator or social media; click through
1. "Hey! I should come back here sometime."
1. ...?

Now you're getting an idea of why writing *sucks*. It's like coding for an OS where the RAM is constantly being flushed and refilled with nonsense. What writing can compete for system resources with *pictures of cats*?

I'll tell you what writing: Writing that shows up daily in your inbox.

###Why this works

Because email is something you *have* to check. If you don't, you lose business. (Or friends.) No one can afford to leave their inbox unmonitored. That means you have a captive audience.

Better, that captive audience has a *great* memory, because inboxes store things forever these days. And inboxes with threading will even organize all the chunks of your work together, if you use the correct SMTP headers.

A newsletter that comes out once a week (or month) is liable to be forgotten, but one that comes out every day (for a fixed period) isn't a newsletter, it's a bloody classroom. Or maybe it was a book. I don't know and I don't care: I'm borrowing this excellent idea. With attribution, of course.

The next time someone is jawing about some new e-Book platform, ask them if it can compete with the oldest technology on the Internet: the humble email, elevated.
