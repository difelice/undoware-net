As promised, here's the sequel to [my writeup about the MedExtra.com website.](https://undoware.ca/medextra-website/). This is part two of a four-part series describing my most recent work. It's not terribly exciting stuff, but that's the idea: this is what I do, day in, day out. (If it were *always* exciting, I'd have run out of exclamation points by now!!!!!!!!!!!!111 oh there we go.)

On the table is medextra.com, a website I recently gave a massive refresh.

After the jump, let's look at a detailed breakdown of what's wrong with the old site.

Without repeating myself, let's just say that there are several outstanding difficulties. Let's characterize them as visual, structural, textual, or usability-related (almost wrote 'unusable'.)

- *Visual difficulties* include the use of stale stock images, gratuitous bevels, and terrible chartreuse/blue combo.
- *Structural difficulties* here mostly boil down to the overstuffing of the main nav
- *Usability-related difficulties* have to do with things like the tiny font size, and an absence of thought regarding what people actually come to the website to do.
- *Textual difficulties* are the most serious. The text really has no idea what it wants the reader of the site to do.

Here's how I fixed it:

Since we've already looked at the first three sort of difficulty in the previous article -- albeit briefly -- let's talk about the text.

Text on a website should never be an afterthought, but it is on the old medextra.com. Like most corporate-originated content, it has about as much character and thrust as an account statement, and may have in fact been written by the accountant (it's a small company.)

When you read over the copy for a website, it should tell a story. The story must always end, "and then you clicked the 'buy' button and lived happily ever after." How you get there is the trick.

First, language level. This is a site that has a broad French-speaking audience. That means that even the English site should be language-level-aware. Note, however, that this does *not* mean the same thing as 'condescending', which is where bad copy often ends up when it tries to optimize for language level. The only way to know if text is doing its job is to have someone of the target demographic read it, and then either collect data about the act of reading, or, under controlled conditions, quiz the reader to assess comprehension. You would be surprised at what surprises non-native speakers of English.

Second, this site sells a complex medical service. This service may or may not interface with your health insurance, your citizenship status, and your employer, and it will certainly involve lots of physicians slinging jargon. This means that the site is going to be text-heavy, or it's not going to be able to do its job. And text-heavy means cognitive load.

*Cognitive load* is exactly what it sounds like -- roughly, it's how much something makes your head hurt. And it's a bad thing when you're selling, because people don't like to buy things that hurt, or worse, make them feel dumb.

We try to reduce the cognitive load on the new site by using metaphors wherever possible. This is the same thing that you hear in political speeches, and we're doing it for the same reason.

*However*, there's a catch. When you reduce cognitive load, it usually happens at some expense to formality. In other words, formal language and easily-understood language are *in tension* with each other, i.e. we can trade one off against the other, but can't have our cake and eat it also.

This would be fine, except as a small business offering a medical service, MedExtra lives and dies by its reputation. And there's a reason why you wear a nice suit to an important meeting instead of khaki shorts: in business contexts, most people find informality less trustworthy. Similarly, in our pursuit of simplicity and reduced cognitive load, we can't let the style become too informal, or we'll start to lose people.

My job was made easier by when I found a cache of PDF brochures produced some time last year. The content wasn't great, but it was a lot fresher than the original website (2004, remember!). At least I knew what the site *should* say, even if I still had to make it sound good.

I then reviewed the service descriptions and made sure that the copy was fact-heavy. Usability research shows that [online reading is relentlessly fact-oriented](http://www.nngroup.com/articles/website-reading/). Facts draw eyeballs; facts satisfy eyeballs; facts mean more eyeballs will come. Thin, vague words like 'excellence' aren't just a waste of space, they actually drive eyeballs away!

Finally, each service description ends with an inviation to call for more information, or (in the case of 'retail' services) a link to a buy-now page, complete with price and PayPal checkout. **A**lways **B**e **C**onverting.
