Following up on last week's TODO list, here are the latest goodies I've added to this site (whose source code is on github, natch.)

----

- *Mobile navigation* is now a lot sexier, following the bottom-bar pattern we're seeing a lot more of, and for which we probably owe grudging thanks to Windows 8. No, really. However, in order to make this work, I've (temporarily) turned off zooming on mobile devices. An upcoming article will discuss the best way of enabling zoom on a site with floating fixed-position elements, such as a bottom navbar, as clearly everyone is having this problem. Still, I'm glad that as a usability-focused site, we now have a usability-focused mobile nav. It was getting pressing. ;)
- The visual branding has received a tweak. The 'zeebra' (or zed-bra, if you must) is now back in the top-left corner, where she belongs.
- Speaking of the zeebra, I was getting a lot of positive feedback about her, so I've made her stand out a bit more. Formerly, she was dark grey on black. The idea was to sync with copy text, subsequently buried on a subpage, that talked about the 'undo' command blending into the background. But really, I was the only one who got it, or even noticed her. But now, she's a bit more self-indulgently showy, like me. (Ahem.)
- New logo: I've discovered that I can smush the 'command' symbol together with a Z, creating this: "<img src='/vector/logo-white.svg' class='inline-pic' alt='inline pic of Undoware logo'/>". I think it's awesome.
- I took off the 'buy' and 'purchase' links. Asking for money in your first breath, or in your nav, is not cool, despite the fact that I believe one should Always Be Converting.
- Most significantly, but least visibly, I've completed the first rev of what I'm calling 'The Shameless Plugboard', a tool to help push blog updates across several different social media services. This drastically reduces the time it takes for me to tell the world I've written something. I'll be talking about The Shameless Plugboard in an upcoming 'moonshot' article, discussing how to use Open Source tools to improve the usability of your workflow.

I didn't get to fix everything I wanted to, however.  Here's what's got my attention this next week:

- Seriously, what the hell is with my CSS sources? Major cleanup and modularization required. It works, but it's spaghetti, darlings.
- Right now, the 'who' page is just a big photo of yours truly. I love that photo, but let's do something proper with the space.
