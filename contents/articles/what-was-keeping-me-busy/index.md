Nontechnical friends often say to me, "Beth, I have no clue what you do for money. I hear you have a site that talks about underwear, and I am drawing certain conclusions."

Were that my life were so racy. :) Instead, I have to repeat my whole spiel -- again -- to an uncaring and uninterested audience -- again. There are few things that kill dinner conversation faster than IT shop talk.

To remedy this, I'd like to just point people at this website. So, over the next few weeks I'll run a series of articles showing off recent projects. As I talk about them, I'll create portfolio entries under a new Portfolio link you'll see in our menu. That way, if someone casts aspersions, I can cast them right back.  

The first entry in the series will be on my recent work making user-friendly technologies that comply with North America's infamously stringent health industry IT security standards. If you've ever cursed at a forgotten password or a lost file, you know at least two of the things that aren't supposed to happen, ever, to your medical record.
