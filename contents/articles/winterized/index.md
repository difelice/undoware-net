I am writing up some developer notes on the upgrades I've just made to this site. The headline change is that it is now created with [Wintersmith](http://wintersmith.io/). It's an amazing Open Source, MIT-licensed tool for snapping out small blogs and websites.

This site used to rock another amazing Open Source product, [the Concrete5 Content Management System](https://www.concrete5.org). While I still have mad respect for Concrete5, it began to feel inappropriate for my own site. Why?
<span class="more"></span>
In the first place, *my use* and *C5's intended use-case* were coming apart. While C5 excels at managing hierarchical content, its support for blog-style rivers of news is currently limited to plugins, the best of which are, as of this writing, all proprietary. From a FOSS perspective, C5 as a blog is a hilariously bad, expensive substitute for WordPress.

But if I wanted WordPress, I'd use WordPress. It wasn't just a *lack* of appropriate features in C5 that compelled the switch: Even the features themselves were getting in my way! The countless and profoundly thoughtful niceties of Concrete 5 eventually became as frustrating as they were convenient, because they abstracted away from the parts of the machine that I'm especially talented at charming. In effect, I was throwing out hundreds of hours of training and research, because I could no longer manage my site with the tools on which I am trained.

In other words, *the same reasons I choose C5 when I'm creating sites for others* -- ease-of-use, abstraction, tight fit with intended use-case -- are *good reasons to avoid it* when making my own. **Usability is user-relative!**

Concrete5 is (still) the first thing I reach for when making a website for someone who doesn't live in a terminal emulator. But that person is no longer me, if it ever was. I do miss the opportunity [to dogfood](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food) C5 ideas on my own site first, but that's what [Turnkey Linux](http://www.turnkeylinux.org/concrete5) appliances are for!

A CMS-based website is like an American SUV with power steering and an automatic transmission and a fur-lined cupholder. But the handling is squishy, and don't even think about engine braking.

Wintersmith, on the other hand, is a bicycle. On a bicycle, I move through traffic like a fish. SUVs are just so many slow-moving, pampered obstacles.
