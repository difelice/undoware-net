I&rsquo;m confident that no other guide to Internet fame has ever started with an imprecation to learn Lua, so first off, let us pause to savor the surprise.

[Pause.]

Now that we're all savored up, let me answer the question that you have bitten clean through your tongue keeping in: why the hell would anyone learn *Lua* as part of getting Internet famous? Why not, say, Node.js? Python? Ruby? PHP, even?

<hr/>

Well. Firstly, Lua is beautiful. Secondly, and most importantly, it is the native language of my favourite text editor, [TextAdept](http://foicica.com/textadept/). I recently switched to textadept after about fifteen years with [vim](http://vim.org) on [the strength of this review](http://yfl.bahmanm.com/Members/ttmrichter/software-reviews/textadept-review). While I love vim, and still occasionally find my fingers twitching out vimcodes in my sleep, I can't help but kill puppies whenever I deal with VimScript. And as [yfl points out](http://yfl.bahmanm.com/Members/ttmrichter/software-reviews/textadept-review), the other extension languages supported by Vim are second-class citizens, often lacking deep API access. Although I have heard that this may be changing, it's 2013 already and I've been waiting for some of those improvements for almost ten years. Yes, I could have made those contributions myself -- gods bless Open Source -- but I didn't, and here we are. I love Vim, but for me, it's time for a change.

It also helps that there are several software packages in my life now that depend intrinsically on Lua. I serve static content with [nginx](http://nginx.org/), and one of my workstations uses the, uh, awesome [Awesome window manager](http://awesome.naquadah.org/) as its wm. While I recommend these packages, they aren't in scope for this conversation, but if you're interested in Lua, check them out.

But back to getting famous on the Internet. :)

Since I now do most of my editing in textadept, and since the tightest subloop in my writing process is the usual 'write-save-upload', it makes sense to apply usability theory's principle of prioritization here. Besides, editor tweaking is fun and easy, or at least it will be once I know Lua.

My next article in this series will cover some basic Lua, as it pertains to textadept configuration for making iteration faster, and thus my workflow more usable.
