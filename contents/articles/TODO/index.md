After the jump: a list of things that need fixing on this site, circa today.

-----

1. The 'before-after' jQuery plugin I grabbed for showing off the MedExtra site doesn't work on mobile, because it's older than two years. Things are speeding up. So it goes. I will have to write a new one. Besides, I don't use jQuery unless I have to, as Angular.js is better, and up-and-comer [Ractive.js](http://www.ractivejs.org/) [sic] is getting a post here soon.
2. The mobile-mode nav for this site is usable but unattractive. It must be fixed. Specifically, to the edges of the screen.
3. I have yet to loopback to my 'moonshot' series of articles, and I was really excited about those. So.
