##I am Liz Mars

You can check out my [résumé](/cv/) and my [GitHub](https://www.github.com/undoware/). Then, come and hang out with me on [Hacker News](http://news.ycombinator.com) or [Twitter](http://twitter.com/undoware). I have recently closed my Google Plus and Facebook accounts in solidarity with those who cannot or will not use their real name online, and thus cannot access these services. 

##Recent-ish work
