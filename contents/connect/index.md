Yours truly is on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/undoware/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/undoware/), as well as [Google Plus](https://plus.google.com/101667909136924896677/posts), where I have somehow amassed hundreds of followers. (Being big on Google Plus is, like being big in Japan, a laurel of mild hilarity.)

If email is more your style, point it at [info@undoware.ca](mailto:info@undoware.ca).

I'm also on [leanpub](https://leanpub.com/u/undoware), where I expect to be working on things soon.


If you *really, literally* want to talk to me -- as in, with your vocal cords -- [you could always call me](tel:+17783743355). Be warned, however, that like most developers I [prefer asynchronous communication](http://www.asaecenter.org/Resources/articledetail.cfm?itemnumber=13572).

Following [the advice of Microsoft's co-founder with regard to meetings](http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html), I avoid them wherever possible. Don't take it personally. I just have to keep making awesome things or my head will explode.
