Portfolio of Past Work
----------------------
 - [undoware.ca/portfolio](https://undoware.ca/portfolio/)


Looking For
-----------
- A chance to kick butt in writing, user interface design, security policy design and enforcement, UX, and/or software development more generally. (As much as I love the front-end, I have a countervailing affinity for cryptography, compilers, and databases.)

History
--------
- __(`2013-â€¦`)__ high-security software development and network administration for a medical services company ([MedExtra](http://medextra.com), Montreal). Deployed and currently maintain end-to-end VPN cryptographic solution, as well as website, several intranet web apps (two custom and written by yours truly), a mail server, AD integration, and... gosh, there is just too much to mention. The whole thing is implemented as a flock of cloud- and local-RAID-backed linux instances coupled with a suite of Mikrotik routers and network appliances, along with a legacy Windows Server installation and  XP deployment. Currently moving all in-house services to FOSS solutions for security, reliability, and increased IT ROI. Currently tasked with overseeing the transition away from related platforms (ACT!) and towards e.g. zurmo.  
- __(`   2012`)__ Built wearable embedded ARM device for exploring [aural AR](http://future.wikia.com/wiki/Augmented_reality#Aural_augmented_reality) and brain-computer HCI (via [NeuroSky](http://neurosky.com/) wearable EEG device.) Technologies: [Pandaboard ES](http://pandaboard.org) (TI OMAP1440: dual-core ARM Cortex A9); [Arch Linux for ARM](http://archlinuxarm.org); [Gluster](http://gluster.org); [LLVM](http://llvm.org)
; etc. etc....
- __(` ~ 2012`)__ Successfully contributed patches to Linux kernel 3.5.x (Telus LTE USB stick support), jQuery 1.7.x (IE7 bugfix), and other Open Source projects
- __(`2011-12`)__ Founder of an unsuccessful (but funded) stealth startup focused on disrupting the online education market. Technologies employed: Sencha Ext4, Sencha Touch, a JDK stack comprising Restlets, Jetty, Rhino, and Clojure; MongoDB, AWS, Fedora Linux, ...
- __(`   2010`)__ Recipient of certificate in user interface design (UX) from the University of British Columbia. Course covered IA and UI development techniques and cutting-edge usability testing techniques
- __(`2008-11`)__ Web Communications Manager for the Faculty of Arts at University of British Columbia. This position comprised not only project management of all departmental and faculty website development projects, but also strategy planning, UX testing, IA card sorting, and wireframing. I was even in charge of editing and managing work-study writers, photographers, and videographers. Finally, I was also responsible for building out the on-campus developer community, and to this end organized workshops and seminars for the on-campus professional web developer community
- __(`   2007`)__ Sessional Lecturer at University of Illinois at Chicago. Designed and taught a survey course on the history of science, mathematics, and ethics
- __(`   2006`)__ Bioethics Research Assistant at the Joint Centre for Bioethics at the University of Toronto. Project: Designing online staff training materials for use in the event of an H5N1 influenza pandemic at Mount Sinai Hospital; documenting emergency triage protocol and Tamiflu/Oseltamivir protocol in a manner accessible to HCWs with a broad range of educational backgrounds under high-stress conditions
- __(` 2005-8`)__ PhD-track Postgraduate and Teaching Assistant at University of Illinois at Chicago. Topics of study: higher-order logic, set theory, cryptography, and computability; also, intellectual property and ethics. Graduated with Masters degree and returned to Canada before completing dissertation
- __(` 2004-5`)__ Technology ESL teacher in Kassel, Germany for BASF group and E.on group executives and IT professionals (2004-5) Two of my students were C-level executives. Class size varied from one-on-one training (for high-level executives) to several dozen, with a focus on language skills necessary to work with English-speaking technology consultants, as well as basic business English
- __(`   2004`)__ Graduated with Honours from McGill University with a Bachelors in Analytic Philosophy (=logic, set theory, cognitive science) and Foundations of Computing (=computability, provability, OS design, compiler design, automata, cryptography, and linear programming)
- __(` 2001-2`)__ Operations and Network Administrator in Montreal (Wirewerks Ltd.) Uniquely responsible for procurement, installation, and disaster planning for all mission-critical databases and networks. Technologies: Red Had Linux; Debian Linux; Windows 2000 Sever; Active Directory; bind, sendmail, Outlook; scheduled & regularly tested off-site backups; database integration (QuickBooks, Access, SQL); workflow design and monitoring; forensics and network intrusion detection with SE Linux; IP/SEC VPN deployment with OpenBSD)
