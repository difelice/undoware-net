Developer Strengths Assessment
------------------------------

- Lots of FOSS experience.
- Currently most fluent in: data-on-the-wire web and mobile app design in Javascript/ECMAScript 6, Angular.js; configuration management tools (e.g. Salt, Ansible, Chef, Puppet)
- Fluent in JavaScript (browser & Node.js); Coffee Script; C; Python; Haskell; Bash; pretty good with Ruby and Java too
- Fifteen years of Adobe Illustrator and Photoshop experience, starting in early adolescence
- I speak Gantt Chart and all other dialects of managerese :)
- World-class grasp of cryptography and network security; vulnerability assessment; code auditing
- Formal training in empirical methodologies for software design and usability assessment, including eye tracking, heat maps, and card sorting

Soft Skills Strengths Assessment
--------------------------------

- Good at mentoring and being mentored
- Positive international workplace experience with C-level execs
- Exceptional, professionally-trained analysis and planning capabilities
- Excellent communicator, thanks to extensive writing, teaching and public speaking experience
- Good at receiving criticism, dammit!
- English is my primary natural language, but I also speak limited French, German, and Japanese.

Bragging Rights
---------------

- I'm doing what I always dreamed of doing. When I was five I announced that I wanted to be an 'inventor', and at fifteen I taught myself C. I am a developer by birth, inclination, and lifelong intent, and I am proud of this.
- In 2011, I got bored waiting for Novatel to update their LTE USB modem support to include the one being sold by Telus, so I wrote a patch updating device detection and submitted it to the maintainer of the driver. It's a trivial patch, but I wrote and submitted the thing all by myself.
- In 2010, like most JavaScript developers, I was frustrated by the buggy support for IE7 in jQuery 1.7.x. It made cross-browser JavaScript even more difficult than usual to code. I managed to isolate a couple of the bugs and submitted a description of the changes required. (I think they went with someone else's patch, but oh well; I still got to report the bug.)

Take-home Message
-----------------

I&rsquo;d like to dev for you. I have a few years of experience in front-end web development, which is my current passion. Backing me up are over ten years of experience in Linux/UNIX server-side development, network & database administration, and deployment. I have demonstrated leadership in project management, public speaking, and community-building. Finally, I'm a published writer, and to top it off, I was recently a PhD-track postgraduate student and lecturer at a major U.S. university (teaching logic).

And unlike some candidates with that kind of experience, I still have an open mind. And I also don't expect to start at the top.
