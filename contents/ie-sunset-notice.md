Uh, I don't know how to tell you this, but...
----------------------------------------------

Whenever a website is re-designed, the developer must make difficult decisions regarding support for outdated browsers. Making a website work on a ten-year-old browser takes longer today than it did ten years ago, because nowadays that same website has to work on many different browsers! Android, iPhone, Firefox, Safari, Chrome.... the list gets longer, not shorter.

Therefore we've dropped **visual design** support for Internet Explorer 9 and below, and **functional design** support for Internet Explorer 8 and below.

Everything on this site is guaranteed to work in IE 9, but it may not be aesthetically satisfying or easy to navigate. But it will be functional: you will be able to view and download files, log in, and perform any other task intended for the site. **This site might not be as pretty, but we guarantee it will still work under IE 9.**

For Internet Explorer 8 and below, we can offer no such guarantees. IE 8 was first released in 2009, way back when the word 'iPad' had to do with feminine hygiene, Windows didn't suck, and Nokia still sold phones people wanted.

The world has changed a lot in the intervening years, and the web along with it. The web must now work on touch devices of all sizes. It must degrade gracefully. It must be responsive. It must progressively enhance, but only when no one is looking. And it must even look okay to the five folks who bought a Surface.

These requirements are not compatible with maintaining a 2000s-era site. Yet we do not think it reasonable to target a four-year-old browser at the expense of tablet users, touchscreen computers. Moreover, given that the process takes only a few minutes and reduces your risk of [malware infection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware), it is reasonable for this site to request that you upgrade your browser.

For most people, there is no reason *not* to upgrade. Contemporary browsers all offer improved security and usability. And an upgrade to [Internet Explorer 11](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Explorer_11) is only a click away in [Windows Update](http://windowsupdate.microsoft.com/).

If you are on a shared computer or workplace workstation that does not permit you to upgrade Internet Explorer yourself, you should request an upgrade from your IT department.

If your IT department is nonresponsive, you might try installing [the PortableApps system](http://portableapps.com) on a USB flash drive, which would allow you to install [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome), [Firefox](http://www.mozilla.org/en-US/), or [Opera](http://www.opera.com/) on your USB flash drive, without harming or altering your computer itself. And once installed, any of these browsers would offer a superior and safer web experience than your current browser. And each of these browsers is capable of importing your IE 'Favorites'
(bookmarks) and other settings.
