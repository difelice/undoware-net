_Undoware_ is the blog of me, [Liz Mars](/who/).

Undoware focuses on the relationship between humanity and technology, especially as it pertains to user interfaces, persuasive design, and subtle forms of social control. This is really just [institutional analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_analysis) pointed at the most contemporary manifestation of bureaucracy.

This is a much more important conversation to have right now than traditional UX, which was this blog's previous focus. But who now gives a crap how easily I can apply one of twenty-six distinct photographic effects to my Instagram snapshots, when it has just been announced that it is the NSA that is compiling the yearbook?

Going forward, we have one agenda, one single article of faith: the network must be usable *by humans*. And human beings have human rights. Like privacy. Like personal security. This is the story of how those things relate to usability. You will be surprised at how tightly the knot is tied.
