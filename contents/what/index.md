'Undoware' is the blog of me, Liz Mars.

Originally, 'undoware' was concerned with one thing: The interface between humans and computers, or HCI (aka UX, usability theory, interaction design, and a hundred other solecistic mouthfuls.) But we have since opened the spotlight.

We now focus on the *relationship* between *humanity* and computers. Call this 'HCR' if you like, but it's really just [institutional analysis](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_analysis) pointed at the most contemporary manifestation of bureaucracy.

This is a much more important conversation to have right now than traditional HCI. Who gives a crap how easily I can apply one of twenty-six distinct photographic effects to my Instagram snapshots, when it has just been announced that it is the NSA that is compiling the yearbook? Who wants to be the next [Arar](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maher_Arar)? We know now that the shenanigans begun by that administration continue uninterrupted. 'Hope' indeed.

Going forward, we have one agenda, one single article of faith: the network must be usable *by humans*. And human beings have human rights. Like privacy. Like personal security. This is the story of how those things relate to usability. You will be surprised at how tightly the knot is tied.

Moreover, we are expanding our tools to include poetry, art, music and fiction, as well as podcasts. Addressing the interface between humans and computers means getting both hands dirty, and human beings are refractory in the face of the sort of pure quantitative analysis that works on computers. Sociology is great, but please don't throw out Shakespeare.
