      <title>Letter to Someone who Believes They Aren't Interesting Enough to Surveil</title>
      <link>https://undoware.net/articles/still-think-like-a-human/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;You still think like a human. ‘to stand out’ is a verb that makes sense only in reference to the human ability to sort through stuff. Computers don’t have the same limits, so &lt;em&gt;everything&lt;/em&gt; stands – stands out, stands in, whatever. You have in communication with me, and that is enough to be of interest. I’m a non-American and I work in security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Remember, computers are machines to find boring things interesting, so it’s easy to be of interest. Surveillance is now so cheap, it’s the opposite that takes effort, like deleting email from gmail.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To help you reset your intuitions, consider: 80% of &lt;em&gt;domestic&lt;/em&gt; U.S. calls are now recorded and accessible to law enforcement, should you ever become important enough. International calls must be assumed to be 100% recorded. FB with politically engaged non-Americans, such as myself, is recorded. It’s all recorded.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Thrilled to be featured this week in &lt;a href=&quot;http://zigest.com/liz-mars&quot;&gt;Zigest&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I wanted to capture how meaning is found, and lost, and found again, and how in the same way that we created urban wilderness, we have created systems of meaning that elude us — a semantic wilderness. The QR code bitfield against which you can see Orion is actually the canonical Lorem Ipsum – aesthetically mangled of course – but the point is you’d never know it. It’s even represented internally to the computer as a font, but again, not for a language you speak. You can only read the words on this piece that were written in fountain pen on paper, and then scanned in. The real text is not for you. You would need to be a machine to experience this work in full.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I used &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.flickr.com/photos/esm723/7291094426/&quot;&gt;this Creative Commons image&lt;/a&gt; in the making of. I need to attribute to Eric Magnuson, whom I’ve never met, but thanks to the magic of Creative Commons, donated a horizon.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to Ray Hsu, who prodded me into submission (I mean, submitting to the journal, ha ha!)&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Here’s a roundup of things I’ve done over the past six weeks:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol style=&quot;list-style-type: decimal&quot;&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Got back into music.&lt;/em&gt; I’ve been working on two songs – my first two songs – for about a year now. They’re doing okay, and I’m going to have something good to put on SoundCloud soon.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Switched hands.&lt;/em&gt; I’ve always been left-handed, but I began doing calligraphy with my right hand as a joke. Guess what? It’s much better than my left-handed handwriting. O_o. More on this unique experience to follow.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Bought paints, began painting and drawing.&lt;/em&gt; (Not again, began period.) More fallout from switching hands.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Regular yoga and meditation&lt;/em&gt; – well, not as regular as I’d like, but better than before, better than nothing.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;em&gt;Cooking&lt;/em&gt;. My partner and I have been upping our culinary game lately, and the flavours are amazing. I love the technical side of cooking. It’s just another art form.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;
&lt;p&gt;With all this awesome, blog posts have sort of trailed off. However, I’ve got a lot of ad hoc public content on my Facebook page that I vow to import here as soon as I have the time to write an RSS feed scraper for the handrolled blogging engine I use. (This is less work than it sounds, but at the moment this is a statically generated site, so there are some wrinkles to accommodate.) I intend to keep this blog going; I promise. There may be more breathers for creative work, however. :D&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Transgender is a transhumanism is a technology</title>
      <link>https://undoware.net/articles/trans-content-in-scope/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 09 Mar 2014 17:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://undoware.net/articles/trans-content-in-scope/</guid>
      <author>ms.liz.mars@gmail.com (Liz Mars)</author>
      <description>&lt;h2 id=&quot;my-partner-might-be-upset-with-me-for-writing-this-post-but-thats-the-point.&quot;&gt;My partner might be upset with me for writing this post, but that’s the point.&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m in the awkward position of having broadened the focus of my blog to the point where it necessarily includes topics that are difficult for me to address without at least delineating where I’m coming from. As you have probably worked out from my &lt;a href=&quot;/portfolio/&quot;&gt;portfolio&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;/who/&quot;&gt;headshot&lt;/a&gt; is that I am indeed trans, aka transsexual, aka transgender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’ve been avoiding discussing this part of my identity for two reasons. One is obviously that you tend to lose non-trans readers when you bring up trans issues. The second is that I feel I should be able to talk about technology ethics and transhumanism without leaning on personal experience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;However, I’ve discovered that many of my positions on technology are shot through with my personal experience. The metaphors and examples I reach for can only be my own. The only way to remain a writer and stay silent on trans issues would be to indulge in what the powers that be now euphemistically call ‘parallel construction’, i.e. lying. And that turns my stomach even more than the fear.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Moreover, while I am still concerned with what potential employers might think of me, I would want to work for someone that puts the courage to have difficult conversations ahead of both expediency and face-saving. And that’s the choice I make by not covering or lying about my identity.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you don’t like this, pause and consider the alternative. By partially erasing myself, I’d partially drive myself back into the closet. It would also deny my readership of important insights, and vivid motivations for those insights. There are few things that commit a person to anarchism or libertarianism more intimately than having to go through several hundred ill-intentioned hoops, just to have a body that doesn’t make you crazy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Of course, there is the other danger too – that in broaching the topic of transness I will never leave, falling forever in a vortex of TMI. But slippery-slope arguments are not good arguments, and between ‘I do not know that of which you speak’ and ‘here is an extreme closeup of my junk’ there are many shades of acceptance and awareness, and a good writer can go to there without getting lost on the way. In a tendentious metaphor, for example.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this is a formal editorial edict, declaring trans issues are in scope for this blog. While this is not a blog with a specific focus on trans rights, it is a blog by a trans writer – me – and when trans issues come up as technology issues – which they always do – we will be ready to talk about them.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;About two months ago, I deleted my Google Plus profile. It was shortly after Google tied G+ to YouTube.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m still extremely wary of social networks, especially post-Snowden. However, I’m a writer, and I need to be read. I have decided to reengage with Google Plus for the same reason I deal with publishers and venues: I want exposure. I resent that every Google service is now a gateway product for Google Plus, which in turn profits from the information it collects, but the same could be set for Twitter, Facebook, Tumblr/Yahoo, or nearly any other number of free online services.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yes, this is selling out. But it’s the kind of baseline selling out required to get your foot in the door, to exist. And I am willing to make that trade.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As part of the change discussed in my previous post, Undoware – this blog – is now focused on the relationship between technology and the culture, rather than just technology and the user. We are expanding into territory that calls for different tools of analysis.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Poems, fiction, art, sketches, and composition are all now fair game. Those of you with an allergy to these will need to find another blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will try to showcase not only my own work, but occasionally also the work of others, as well as links to anything interesting seen elsewhere. We will pay especially close attention to cryptography, Open Source, writing, politics, music, and gender.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I will also be adding a portfolio of my work specifically, including past failures. I have recently come around to the view that most failures occur because a previous failure was either misunderstood, or the wrong lessons were taken from it, often out of the anxiety and shame that necessarily follow failure. Addressing these emotions also helps avoid future error.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Snowden, Usability, and Institutional Analysis</title>
      <link>https://undoware.net/articles/snowden-ux-ia/</link>
      <pubDate>Fri, 24 Jan 2014 16:00:00 -0800</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://undoware.net/articles/snowden-ux-ia/</guid>
      <author>ms.liz.mars@gmail.com (Liz Mars)</author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;It’s been over half a year since my previous post.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was going to tell you about the drive crash I had last summer, and how it wiped me out for a few months (never trust your backups, ever!) But the real reason I stopped writing is irrelevance. Let me explain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When I started this blog, I wanted to promote usability advances. But while important, these don’t interest me nearly as much as what I began privately calling ‘socio-usability’, or the study of how usability is already being used to further specific policy goals. I read &lt;em&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.amazon.com/The-Dictators-Learning-Curve-Democracy/dp/030747755X&quot;&gt;The Dictator’s Learning Curve&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, and independently began learning about &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Institutional_analysis&quot;&gt;institutional analysis&lt;/a&gt;. Thus I realized that ‘socio-usability’ already had a name.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;And then Chelsea Manning’s trial happened. And the Snowden NSA revelations happened, and kept happening, like an enormous tuning fork of horror, ringing out its totalitarian message throughout the newfallen darkness. It took out &lt;a href=&quot;https://groklaw.net&quot;&gt;groklaw&lt;/a&gt;, and I guess, in a much less noble way, myself as well. I stopped writing because I realized my whole chosen topic was beside the point.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized then that I needed to write about the relationship between social control, convenience, and user interface design. This field, when it does not specifically involve computer user interfaces, is called &lt;em&gt;institutional analysis&lt;/em&gt;. Although it is standardly not interested in the works of traditional usability—it has roots in activism rather than captialism—it should be. It and UX theory have much to teach each other. I want to help with this.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I am also lucky enough to be working professionally in the NSA mitigation field: post-Snowden, my employer (who is, like me, Canadian) requested that I move several key systems in-house. I now make my bread improvising solutions to the massive holes the NSA has drilled in the network’s security system. This makes me proud, but also vividly aware of the significance of Snowden’s revelations.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Originally, this blog was concerned with one thing: The interface between humans and computers. But now we will open the spotlight slightly. We now focus on the &lt;em&gt;relationship&lt;/em&gt; between &lt;em&gt;humanity&lt;/em&gt; and computers. Call this ‘HCR’ if you like, but it’s really just institutional analysis, but pointed at the most contemporary manifestation of bureaucracy. This is a much more important conversation to have right now than traditional HCI. Who gives a crap how easily I can apply one of twenty-six distinct photographic effects to my Instagram snapshots, when it has just been announced that it is the NSA that is compiling the yearbook? Who wants to be the next &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maher_Arar&quot;&gt;Arar&lt;/a&gt;? We know now that the shenanigans begun by that administration continue uninterrupted. ‘Hope’ indeed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Going forward, we have one agenda, one single article of faith: the network must be usable &lt;em&gt;by humans&lt;/em&gt;. And human beings have human rights. Like privacy. Like personal security.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m with the leakers–and so are your interests, citizen, no matter what your personal politics might be. Onward.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Avoiding the Tragedy of the Open Source Commons (1997)</title>
      <link>https://undoware.net/articles/avoiding-tragedy-1998/</link>
      <pubDate>Mon, 29 Jul 2013 23:01:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://undoware.net/articles/avoiding-tragedy-1998/</guid>
      <author>ms.liz.mars@gmail.com (Liz Mars)</author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://slashdot.org/features/older/9806121215257.shtml&quot;&gt;I wrote an editorial that got published on Slashdot in 1998&lt;/a&gt;, the year I left home for university. It was vaguely in reply &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Cathedral_and_the_Bazaar&quot;&gt;to something Eric S Raymond&lt;/a&gt; wrote. (IIRC, he replied!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;My writing has mercifully improved, but you know what? I spotted something important, way back then: the incentives of Open Source favour endless forking. Fortunately, with the advent of git, forking became much cheaper for a FOSS project to deal with, as git makes patches easier to upstream. The huge glut of developers that emerged in the early ’00s also alleviated any developer scarcity brought about by ego-incentives. Thus the doom portended did not in fact tend. (Or whatever.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The full text, in all its adolescent glory, after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;avoiding-the-tragedy-of-the-commons&quot;&gt;Avoiding the Tragedy of the Commons&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The economics of free software are strange by almost any measure. The produce i s in near-infinite supply; labor is given freely; goods can be replicated easil y and indeed come bearing licenses that actually encourage people to do so. As suggested by Eric S. Raymond, the standard rules of scarcity seem to be inappli cable at best - leaving some with the fervent hope that maybe, just maybe, free software’s ‘bubble’ of warped economic space/time will permit it to pull off a stunning victory against the Microsoft Blight by magically, confoundingly chan ging the rules of the game itself.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But the problem is this: Even bubbles have to interface with the Real World(tm) somewhere. Although there may not be a scarcity of goods or even ideas, there is and will probably always be a scarcity of laborers - or, more accurately, a scarcity of /interested/ and /available/ laborers. The freedom that has allowed open source software to flourish could soon threat en its very existence. As free software rises to prominence, the potential of b ecoming a Famous and Distinguished Project Leader (in the same lineage as Linus , RMS and Larry Wall, etc) could very well lead new programmers to found a mill ion small and essentially vaporous projects rather than a few, important ones.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;As ESR points out in his excellent ‘Homesteading the Noosphere’, one of free software’s greatest kickbacks is reputation. We work upon the scarcity of celebrity. The leaders of the best and most widely-loved projects - Linux, GCC, Perl, the Gimp - the kind of hero status envied by third world dictators. These people simply have truckloads of the stuff. They’re flush. Unfortunately, the many dozens or hundreds of minor contributors labour in obscurity. In terms of fame, contributing patches to a major project is /nothing/. How many minor patch con tributors to the Linux kernel can the average user name off-hand? Quick, withou t looking at the sources: Who helped add HAM support to 2.1.x? Or who roughed i n support for non-ide Sony CDROM drives, way back when? Oh, sure, people do con tribute this stuff; it isn’t like anyone is /obsessed/ with celebrity. The free software commmunity seems to approach even its internal currency with inspirat ional moderation. The point, however, is that only select handful benefit fame- wise from participation in somebody else’s project. The rest are relegated to t he dustbin of the credits file. Surely the temptation must exist to take a shot at real fame, no matter what the odds.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;How many potential free software coders will ever be ‘generous’ enough to parti cipate in the Revolution without any sort of alterior motive? Hell, how many cu rrent free software coders (which, BTW, are already a minority in a profession undergoing a manpower shortage of its own) will continue plugging away as unkno wns when glory and untold riches await them as the potential founders of new an d wildly successful IRC programs($I), network games, or mp3 players? Why muck a bout with boring user interfaces when they could jump at the chance to craft th e very flesh and bone of a project or feature that is entirely their own baby?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our greatest fear should not be a crushing blow by Microsoft but a death by a t housand apps and a kind of malignant featurism that poisons the body of Free So ftware not through neglect but through /overlife/. Random, undirected diversity is the creed of a tumour. Resources in this growing body are to be rationed, a nd its benefactors rewarded not only for their contribution to the pot but for the &lt;em&gt;kind&lt;/em&gt; of contribution they make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In short, we need to start learning the value of the unsexy, the plain, the bor ing and the pedantic. And I say this with the most emphatic ‘we’. Unless the co mmunity as a whole increments the perceived value of the guys doing grunt work, we could end up with a lot of meaningless little nothings, piles of pale and f lightless applications with version numbers all in deep pre-natal floating-poin t decimals. The old ditty about schoolmarks being the average, not the sum of t est results could be rewritten for Linux: The OS is the multiple, not the sum, of all software present.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;An interesting example of this principle (let’s call it, in the interests of fa me, Marston’s Principle) would probably be the Enlightenment theme community. A lthough I’ve only run Enlightenment a couple of times (both screen real estate and ram being in short supply), a quick stroll through the Enlightenment sectio n of themes.org reveals development run amok. The user is greeted by a littany of half-completed themes, many of which profess not only great ugliness but the sort of awkward placement of controls that really cruel scientists would use t o test the intelligence of lab rats.($E) But hey - what does it matter? We’ve g ot a whole fscking /load/ of themes available. What wonderful diversity, ha ha!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Contrast this with the Mac’s Kaliedoscope(&lt;span class=&quot;math inline&quot;&gt;\(K). Kaliedoscope, if you&amp;#39;ve ever had to use it, is simply a joy and wonder to behold. The themes are largely clean, comprehensive, efficient and just to /die/ for, visually. The development grou p is reputed to be small and tight-knit - not exactly the kind of Bazaar that t he new elite is touting, but an efficient and productive group nonetheless. And although there aren&amp;#39;t exactly tons of &amp;#39;looks&amp;#39; available, those that do exist a re clean, attractive, and effective. There are major organs I would gladly dona te to have that kind of UI elegance under Linux.(\)&lt;/span&gt;O)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Personally, I feel that the next guy to release a New And Innovative windowing tookit, file manager or IRC client should be shot on sight. We have Qt. We have Gtk+. We have KDE and we have Gnome($D). Please, for the love of God, Kibo or whatever other deity you worship - please, no more! Fold your work into someone else’s. Swallow your pride, and wait for the rest of the world to catch up to you.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the mean time, however, consider these faint point-lights of hope. First, th ere is the possibility that at least some of the problem could be self-correcti ng. As the number of available linux programs grows, the perceived value of bei ng a team leader could undergo inflation. Although non-central contributors to projects get far less recognition than they should, the leaders of piddly proje cts could risk getting lost in the shuffle. The same self-interest that would u sually compel them to homestead new territory could lead to a return to the les s-promising but less risky position of ‘contributor’. Secondly, we might be abl e to mitigate the situation somewhat with our current policy of vigorous standa rds and ‘accretion engineering’. By basing free software on recognised protocol s (and, for that matter, recognised user interfaces), we leave a path open for future consolidation and raise community’s coherency index a notch. And instead of slashing and burning huge bodies of poorly written code each time the versi on number is incremented, we should instead strive for a policy of constant and steady growth through clean APIs, public standards and boringly hygenic coding practices. It is no accident or anachronism that Linux is built upon the conve ntions of a twenty-year-old operating system. Be as unified as you can with the rest of the Free Software movement, or even future Free Software movements, ev en if you never see their faces.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We are not Microsoft; we cannot sprint. But we can run.($R) It’s just up to us to make sure our software runs as well as we. Work slowly, collectively, to pol ish one essential after another. Listen to hype - and fame - at great non-perso nal peril. With time, and modesty, we can yet avoid the Tragedy of the Commons.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$I: Because the only good clients are sirc and BitchX anyway, so what’s the point in trying? :P&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$E: I have nothing against Enlightenment, and I’m sure that E0.14 has many wonderful technical merits. I just hate the themes people make.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$K: An enlightenment-like themer for Mac that changes the style of menus, windows and widgets. Very cool.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$O: Things that I have two of, mostly. A kidney or a lung.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;$R: I was going to try to make a lame metaphor/pun about redwoods versus Redmond, but it ended up sounding terribly awkward, so. :)&lt;/p&gt;

      <author>ms.liz.mars@gmail.com (Liz Mars)</author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;This site is now open source, and the content is Creative Commons. It’s all on &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/undoware/www-undoware-ca/&quot;&gt;GitHub.com&lt;/a&gt;. Find out why after the jump.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;hr /&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-is-this-important&quot;&gt;Why is this important?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Because Open Source and Creative Commons are both important. They are important to me. And they are absolutely crucial to the normal functioning of the modern world, although you’d never know it from the media. The same media that is almost universally hosted on Open Source operating systems, running Open Source frameworks. We are hidden in plain sight.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;why-the-multiple-licenses&quot;&gt;Why the multiple licenses?&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I realized I’d be angry if someone ran my articles and profited from them, because I’m writing them for free. So the articles, and the articles alone, are under a license that prohibits commercial reuse without my explicit permission.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also realized that I care somewhat less about visual assets I produce, but I still want the fame, if any, ;), so they are under a CC license that is very similar to the MIT license. I didn’t just go with MIT because I think it’s better to use CC licenses for content and FOSS licenses for code – it seemed better to use a screwdriver as a screwdriver, instead of a hammer.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;foss-contributions&quot;&gt;FOSS contributions&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I think this is the first time someone has released a blog template for &lt;a href=&quot;http://wintersmith.io&quot;&gt;Wintersmith&lt;/a&gt; that has Disqus and Google Tracking, autogenerated sitemaps, and support for Stylus and &lt;a href=&quot;http://livescript.net&quot;&gt;LiveScript&lt;/a&gt;. The code is imperfect, but if it is of use to you, please, take what you need.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I’m also proud to contribute written content to the cause. While technical writing is a lot less glamorous than coding, it is the flux capacitor of Open Source: &lt;em&gt;nothing&lt;/em&gt; works without it. Undocumented code is almost as bad as code without a license.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Winnowing the Self-rapt</title>
      <link>https://undoware.net/articles/self-rapt/</link>

      <author>ms.liz.mars@gmail.com (Liz Mars)</author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I applied for a job at a &lt;a href=&quot;http://forgeandsmith.com/&quot;&gt;local web design firm&lt;/a&gt;, and as a sample of my work, I included a brief critique of the site, laquered in several paragraphs of praise. Between the layers of praise, I pointed out that it bore excessive resemblance to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://twitter.github.io/bootstrap/&quot;&gt;Twitter Cookiecutt&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;H&lt;sup&gt;H&lt;/sup&gt;H Bootstrap&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got back a helpful tip: “critiquing a companies site design in your first email is not a super great way to leave a good impression.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This makes me happy. Not accepting design feedback is a terrible way of being a developer, or a boss. And it’s the worst way of finding people who will tell the emperor the truth about that the breeze he feels.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is a reason art school begins and ends with critique. As do philosophy, literature, and music. And science. And good work of any sort.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Good companies know to hire people that provide good criticism. In fact, I was inspired by the story of 21-year-old designer &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minimallyminimal.com&quot;&gt;Andrew Kim&lt;/a&gt;, whose &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.minimallyminimal.com/2012/7/3/the-next-microsoft.html&quot;&gt;vigilante critique of Microsoft’s branding&lt;/a&gt; got him &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.theverge.com/2013/1/19/3895444/andrew-kim-the-next-microsoft-designer-hired-by-xbox&quot;&gt;hired by Microsoft&lt;/a&gt;. (And I &lt;em&gt;still&lt;/em&gt; can’t believe I just called Microsoft a ‘good’ company. Relative merits!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;From now on, &lt;em&gt;every&lt;/em&gt; job application includes a brief critique, to weed out the employers who are self-rapt.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Time Travel Alert!</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a brand new blog, but I’m not. I have over a decade’s worth of scattered writing on several topics, some dating from as early as puberty. Many of them, believe it or not, are usability-related, and I want to share them.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Yet, unlike me, some of them have aged poorly.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I could either (a) bury them, (b) insert them silently at the beginning of this blog’s timeline, or (c) reblog them in block quotes. But (a) is wasteful and (b) seems vaguely dishonest, so by elimination I pick (c).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So the next time you see an article with a headline like ‘The Miracle of Server-Side Includes’, or ‘AJAX: Could it be the future?’ please do not run outside screaming, “too soon! I’ve come back too soon!” You are right when you need to be – safe here in 2013, a couple of weeks before the tritonium riots on the &lt;em&gt;USSR Mir III&lt;/em&gt; low Earth orbital platform.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Cryptography is a Thought Thermos</title>

      <author>ms.liz.mars@gmail.com (Liz Mars)</author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I wrote the following while explaining DRM to a friend on Google Plus.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A secret is information that you and the recipient (in this case, the recipient is a consumer media device) share, but is not shared with the bad guys (in this case, the consumers). Mathematically, you can describe this as a decrease in entropy (because physics tells us that heat is released when information is destroyed; ergo Hawking radiation etc.) We say that Alice and Bob, who don’t want to be overheard by Eve or Mallory, have lower entropy than Eve or Mallory (only relevant in our idealized system, however – in real life, the thermal difference between knowing and not knowing something is too tiny to measure.) Since Alice and Bob share a secret, they are able to better organize the ciphertext (i.e. they are able to understand it.) This is because increased complexity, by complexity theory, is the opposite of entropy.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;hr/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;(Speaking of which, your mind should feel like it’s melting about now. The identification of heat with information loss is so counterintuitive it took me six months of napkin equations to believe it. Quick hint: remember that Alice-the-physical-system must have a complete copy of the plaintext and secret within her, and so must Bob, whereas Mallory and Eve do not; all they have is the ciphertext, which without the secret cannot be ‘compressed’ into a parse tree, and that means it’s going to be as good as random to them. Random is chaotic, and entropy is the march of chaos, which we experience as heat. Now excuse me while I go trip out somewhere thinking about this. )&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If the entropy ‘spills’ out of Eve or Mallory and into Alice or Bob, that constitutes the destruction of the secret and the acquisition of knowledge by Eve or Mallory. A good cryptographic system is essentially (and absolutely literally) a very specific sort of insulation that maintains a thermal difference between Alice-Bob and the rest of the world. And since we’ve got lots of tools from other branches of math to model thermals, this suits us just dandy, as we can use those tools to characterize the difference between the Alice-Bob axis and Mallory (some deceiver) and Eve (some evesdropper.) In other words, we have reduced the hazy, everyday notion of ‘secret’ to cold hard math, and if that doesn’t shock you nothing will. ;3&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <title>Winterized</title>

      <author>ms.liz.mars@gmail.com (Liz Mars)</author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;I am writing up some developer notes on the upgrades I’ve just made to this site. The headline change is that it is now created with &lt;a href=&quot;http://wintersmith.io/&quot;&gt;Wintersmith&lt;/a&gt;. It’s an amazing Open Source, MIT-licensed tool for snapping out small blogs and websites.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This site used to rock another amazing Open Source product, &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.concrete5.org&quot;&gt;the Concrete5 Content Management System&lt;/a&gt;. While I still have mad respect for Concrete5, it began to feel inappropriate for my own site. Why? &lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt; In the first place, &lt;em&gt;my use&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;C5’s intended use-case&lt;/em&gt; were coming apart. While C5 excels at managing hierarchical content, its support for blog-style rivers of news is currently limited to plugins, the best of which are, as of this writing, all proprietary. From a FOSS perspective, C5 as a blog is a hilariously bad, expensive substitute for WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;But if I wanted WordPress, I’d use WordPress. It wasn’t just a &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of appropriate features in C5 that compelled the switch: Even the features themselves were getting in my way! The countless and profoundly thoughtful niceties of Concrete 5 eventually became as frustrating as they were convenient, because they abstracted away from the parts of the machine that I’m especially talented at charming. In effect, I was throwing out hundreds of hours of training and research, because I could no longer manage my site with the tools on which I am trained.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In other words, &lt;em&gt;the same reasons I choose C5 when I’m creating sites for others&lt;/em&gt; – ease-of-use, abstraction, tight fit with intended use-case – are &lt;em&gt;good reasons to avoid it&lt;/em&gt; when making my own. &lt;strong&gt;Usability is user-relative!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Concrete5 is (still) the first thing I reach for when making a website for someone who doesn’t live in a terminal emulator. But that person is no longer me, if it ever was. I do miss the opportunity &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eating_your_own_dog_food&quot;&gt;to dogfood&lt;/a&gt; C5 ideas on my own site first, but that’s what &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.turnkeylinux.org/concrete5&quot;&gt;Turnkey Linux&lt;/a&gt; appliances are for!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A CMS-based website is like an American SUV with power steering and an automatic transmission and a fur-lined cupholder. But the handling is squishy, and don’t even think about engine braking.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Wintersmith, on the other hand, is a bicycle. On a bicycle, I move through traffic like a fish. SUVs are just so many slow-moving, pampered obstacles.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Why the Mechanical Pencil</title>
      <link>https://undoware.net/articles/why-mechanical-pencil/</link>
      <pubDate>Sun, 31 Mar 2013 17:00:00 -0700</pubDate>
      <guid isPermaLink="true">https://undoware.net/articles/why-mechanical-pencil/</guid>
      <author>ms.liz.mars@gmail.com (Liz Mars)</author>
      <description>&lt;p&gt;The mechanical pencil – or I should say, a &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; mechanical pencil – is a perfection of craft. It is light; it is fine; it ideally has a little high-density eraser under the cap. The mechanism used by most mechanical pencils is far more beautiful and &lt;em&gt;explicable&lt;/em&gt; than a pen’s glorified plumbing. The mechanical pencil’s gaskets and grabbers and brass clutch are just cool, and the traditional hexagonal barrel is a usability triumph.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;span class=&quot;more&quot;&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mechanical pencil ‘ink’ is utterly standardized, and can be purchased for almost nothing. (It’s carbon. Elementally, you’re writing in your own blood.) You can write on a plane, you can write upside down, and, it is said, under water. But despite all this, the pencil is humble, allowing its words to be parted from its page, should it err.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There are warts too of course. The most pressing for me is the delicacy of the nib: a surprising number of inferior mechanical pencils have a fixed-tube nib that gets damaged easily, forcing you to re-buy. Do not fall for these harlots. If you’re spending less than $30 on a mechanical pencil, get one with a conical nib that can be ‘retracted’ by pushing on it with your finger, or even one of the fancier models that has a full spring-loaded retraction system (although I question the usefulness of these over just pushing the nib into the casing with a fingertip.)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you have money to spend and you do (even occasional) drafting, diagramming or figuring, you should get a pencil with a proper drafter’s nib. This looks &lt;em&gt;identical&lt;/em&gt; to the cheap fixed barrel I made fun of not two paragraphs ago, except (a) it’s made out of a &lt;em&gt;real&lt;/em&gt; metal, thus ensuring its continued function past the 2-week mark, and (b) it’s handy for drafting, and, unlike a conical nib, which tends to jam in tight corners, a fixed barrel &lt;em&gt;of reasonable quality&lt;/em&gt; is suitable for all but the most delicate work. A cheap one, however, will break your heart, and possibly your skin.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;While sturd_ier_, these pencils still must be treated like royalty, as damage to the nib is a showstopper. You should wince when you drop one. Thus I recommend a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.pelican.com&quot;&gt;Pelican&lt;/a&gt; case. They have a thick rubber liner that I trust.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Before I get to the rest of my recommendations, I want to give props to &lt;a href=&quot;http://davesmechanicalpencils.blogspot.ca/&quot;&gt;Dave’s Mechanical Pencils&lt;/a&gt;, which is run by one of the few people I trust to understand my obsession. He’s the guy who put me on to Rotring, and how to still get the metal-bodied classic, via Japanese eBay.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Enough about Dave, let’s get back to what &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; recommend. Guess what my first recommendation is? :) Yep, a Rotring. Not the mass-produced Buffalo-owned Rotrings that you get these days, but &lt;a href=&quot;http://davesmechanicalpencils.blogspot.ca/2010/02/rotring-600-mechanical-pencil-review.html&quot;&gt;the Rotring 600&lt;/a&gt;, an early-00’s metal-bodied classic with a matte-powder black finish. They’re only still sold in Japan. Don’t ask me why I have to order a German design from Japan, but I did, and it was worth it. It was $40 by the time I got it in my hot little Canadian paws. (Thanks, eBay user &lt;a href=&quot;http://myworld.ebay.ca/motohashi001company/&amp;amp;_trksid=p3984.m1439.l2754&quot;&gt;motohashi001company&lt;/a&gt;!)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Second, my daily driver. It lives in my pocket, hooked to a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.leuchtturm.com/&quot;&gt;Leuchtturm&lt;/a&gt; notebook. It’s a sturdy, heavily-scuffed, bright-red &lt;a href=&quot;http://davesmechanicalpencils.blogspot.ca/2006/07/caran-dache-ecridor-mechanical-pencil.html&quot;&gt;Caran d’Ache Ecridor&lt;/a&gt; and looks and feels like a long, smooth, hexagonal lego brick. The nib is conical and can be pushed up inside for transport. My Ecridor was purchased at &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.yelp.ca/biz/the-vancouver-pen-shop-vancouver&quot;&gt;Vancouver Pen Shop&lt;/a&gt;, back before I knew anything. (A big thanks to their knowledgable reps!) I later discovered that &lt;a href=&quot;http://davesmechanicalpencils.blogspot.ca/2006/07/caran-dache-ecridor-mechanical-pencil.html&quot;&gt;Dave’s Mechanical Pencils has a review of the Ecridor&lt;/a&gt;; he seems to appreciate it about as much as I do.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Finally, the One that Got Away. I used to have a &lt;a href=&quot;http://davesmechanicalpencils.blogspot.ca/2006/02/pentel-sharp-kerry-p1035-mechanical.html&quot;&gt;Pentel Kerry&lt;/a&gt;, also from Vancouver Pen Shop. It’s a great pencil, and the lid is perfection itself, glossily sliding into place with a reassuring click. It even has what I can only call a ‘passthrough button’, allowing the lead to be advanced even when the cap is stowed away on the back end. Sadly, this wondrous lid made this pencil a little &lt;em&gt;too&lt;/em&gt; portable for me, and I lost my Kerry somewhere. I haven’t rebought because (a) been there and (b) the pen’s heavy design, while elegant, looks a bit too masculine for my taste; I want to write with it, not fell deer. It’s the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model_M_keyboard&quot;&gt;Model M&lt;/a&gt; of mechanical pencils, and as much as I love my &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.daskeyboard.com&quot;&gt;Das Keyboard&lt;/a&gt;, it’s not the sort of thing I’d want to flash around. Or move around. Or stand under.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A last word on left-handedness and pencils. You will smudge. Period. But you can smudge &lt;em&gt;less&lt;/em&gt; if you avoid the ‘southpaw hook’ and retrain your muscles to write from the bottom of the line. The smudges themselves are far less showstop-y than ink smudges, and the pale silver sheen on the heel of my left hand tells the world that I’ve been working.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;When was the last time your keyboard ever told the world you were working? Twitter doesn’t count. :P&lt;/p&gt;
