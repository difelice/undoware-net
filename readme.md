This is a skeleton/template for making CouchApps using a combination of Angular.js, Ink, require.js, Jade, Stylus, LiveScript, Wintersmith, Font Awesome, Fira, and several other fantastic Open Source projects. It works for me. Sucks if it doesn't for you. I use it for all my apps. 



License
-------

MIT, out of necessity (it's too hard fighting license impedance mismatch) but
my heart is with the GPL. Such is life -- you don't always get what you want,
even in FOSS. The most important thing for me is that people benefit from this
while respecting the spirit of giving.  If you make something awesome, I
request (but do not require) that you make it Open Source.


TODO: Finish marking all the source files originating with this project with
the MIT license.

Usage
